This is an unofficial orb used to install Kubescape in your CircleCI pipeline and scan for security issues in Kubernetes. Contributions are welcome!

## Features
### **Secure By Design**
- **Least Privilege**: Installs to a user-owned directory by default, with no `sudo` usage anywhere in this orb.
- **Integrity**: Checksum validation of all downloaded binaries using SHA-512.
- **Provenance**: Installs directly from Kubescape's official [releases page](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/releases/) on GitHub. No third-party websites, domains, or proxies are used.
- **Confidentiality**: All secrets and environment variables are handled in accordance with CircleCI's [security recommendations](https://circleci.com/docs/security-recommendations/) and [best practices](https://circleci.com/docs/orbs-best-practices/).
- **Privacy**: No usage data of any kind is collected or shipped back to the orb developer.

Info for security teams:
- Required external access to allow, if running a locked down, self-hosted CircleCI pipeline on-prem:
  - `github.com`: For download and installation of the Kubescape tool.
